##

I design and evaluate systems for autonomous coordination, spatial state management, and definition alignment. My current work spans distributed decision frameworks, uncertainty-aware state propagation, and the interfaces that make these systems auditable and adaptable. Some parallel research explores photonic approaches to information flow and adaptive optics for controlled light fields. Select artifacts are public; most work remains private.

## Areas of Focus

- **Autonomy & Coordination**  
  Multi-agent task allocation, reputation-weighted arbitration, resilience under partial information.

- **State & Consensus**  
  Methods for converging on shared state across heterogeneous agents; strategies for handling drift, decay, and confirmation.

- **Spatial Computation**  
  Abstractions for mutable spatial definitions and region-level behaviors; practical tooling for observation and reconciliation.

- **Photonics & Adaptive Optics**  
  Early-stage investigations into lightfield control, beam shaping, and holographic/diffractive methods for structured propagation.

- **Interfaces & Governance**  
  Human-in-the-loop review, transparent audit paths, and policy surfaces for operational safety and accountability.

## Current Work (High Level)

- Designing minimal, composable kernels for distributed coordination and state tracking.  
- Developing review and confirmation flows that reconcile subjective observations into stable definitions.  
- Prototyping lightweight tools to monitor change, verify stability, and manage decay of stale assumptions.  
- Exploring whether photonic primitives can support volumetric signaling or sensing pathways for future systems.

## Selected Topics of Interest

- Uncertainty modeling and confirmation economics  
- Region-level behaviors and multi-block dynamics  
- Identity-scoped weighting in consensus formation  
- Time-aware visualization of evolving definitions  
- Practical guardrails for safe deployment in mixed human/machine settings

## Public Artifacts (Selected, Infrequent)

> Note: most work is not public. The following representative utilities are intentionally generic.

- `coord-kernel` — scaffolds for distributed coordination experiments  
- `state-watcher` — small utilities for change detection and stability checks  
- `viz-minimal` — low-noise views for time-evolving state

## Background Notes

My applied work is complemented by structured craft disciplines. I occasionally reference bonsai practice as a model for long-horizon iteration: deliberate constraints, measured intervention, and verifiable growth over time.
